I'm having a problem.
I have assembled the code as recommended and Eclipse is reporting an error on...

  public Database getDatabase() {
  return this.db;
  }

Error = The return type is incompatible with JavaPlugin.getDatabase()

Eclipse wants me to change 'Database' to 'EbeanServer' which results in another error on the return as the type is wrong.
